That's so good!! 😘👏🏾Congrats! 🎉🎉🎉👏🏾 https://t.co/AZgWVMzd45Wrong is wrong period. https://t.co/Xj4PeE7IcHDoing something in the past that you regret does not equate to having past racist tendencies. Two completely different things.I still support Kim 100% but I also do not support her defense rant against Jeffree Star 😤You can't tell people to forgive &amp; move on about racist comments when the comments weren't even directed towards you.I too was also disappointed and shocked by Kim's Snapchat rant telling us to stop bringing up Jeffree's racist past. Racism is NOT a joke.My exact same sentiments. 😕 https://t.co/R3bpXdN7W4He's upset that he KNOWS kim won't collaborate him because of his problematic past &amp; present.  ☕️🙃 https://t.co/h0WrMIhHIn@MyleezaKardash @AKutieNameKim  https://t.co/jQ82ghyKL2@MyleezaKardash @AKutieNameKim  https://t.co/bgwUx7iIlY@MyleezaKardash @AKutieNameKim  https://t.co/u2oc7H2VNI@MyleezaKardash @AKutieNameKim  https://t.co/IlCbY4QYAI@MyleezaKardash @AKutieNameKim I got you https://t.co/u6MNlexYUB👑👑👑 https://t.co/lGgUJkaII3
