They were traitors and should not be honored for killing Americans.We know who they are coach. Time to call them out üëÄüëÄSilence=empowerment-lots of "friends" quiet last few days. Not afraid to attack college kids protesting  a graduation? Silence spks voulmesSame people outraged that folks won't stand for anthem, voted for @realDonaldTrump who empowers Nazis and White Supremacists. 2 wars vs bothSaid this since August '16, if you voted for @realDonaldTrump you voted for everything that's wrong with our country. You know who you are.Some good news from yesterday! https://t.co/HIgOgXgBYfTonight @jimmybuffett closed his show talking about a tough week for America. One Love was the message.  #Charlotteville #onecountry https://t.co/KElV951Nx5Madness in this country today. Glad to escape to Margaritaville with these guys for a few hours! @ianthom5 @billy_thom @jimmybuffett https://t.co/bQKacZvavIPoor service here at Jones Beach, but seems @realDonaldTrump sided with Nazis and white supremacists today. Thankful to be in MargaritavilleSocial media holding bigots and racists accountable for their deplorable actions. Beautiful thing! https://t.co/Aqvm5em1E5#lgbt community let's not let #charlottesville take away from the bigotry in Texas with #SB3 - will hurt so many trans brothers and sistersThis would be apprope, @realDonaldTrump pardoning a racist, while embroiled in his own racial controversy. #deplorable https://t.co/2fCRn8bEo5Watching @realDonaldTrump respond to criticism is like a reading a cheap novel. Right to his base and anti-media rhetoric. #deplorablesMental illness is real. Never thought the commander in chief would be the prime example. @realDonaldTrumpLeaders are running for cover from @realDonaldTrump took a race riot to wake people up. We have hope. #Charolettesville@CoachDMurray1 @CNN Pheeww, I didn't want to....These people committed treason trying oppress an entire group of people and committed horrible atrocities. Should not be honored, ever.The civil war is part of our history and should be remembered. However, Confederate monuments have no place in public spaces.Not hard to understand. If u screw up when in position of power, you get criticized. @realDonaldTrump should be quiet accept failure.@bross_mike Your observation is just that, whether you believe it or not. Perception is everythingCan't wait to see my guy @jimmybuffett tomorrow in Margaritaville, Long Island! @ianthom5 @billy_thom üçπüå¥üèñü¶à https://t.co/2zRJZa82db@bross_mike An idiot posting has zero to do with the pic. Have to be careful not constantly look for conflict, the fight becomes less meaningful.@bross_mike Totally disagree with this tweet. Not fair to pigeon hole people you don't know based off a pic. No idea what lives like away from scene.@spenser_clark @realDonaldTrump Said it was the most powerful of HIS career, following his first domestic crisis. Also said, holds no weight if he proceeds normally.
