@astroehlein @hrw It's a race to the bottom, eh, @realDonaldTrump? Your move, Cheeto-in-Chief.@realDonaldTrump Exactly how many minority applicants did your slum houses reject? Is it because you were trying to protect them from your shitty housing?@realDonaldTrump Exactly what was your dad's role in the KKK? Asking for a friend.@aigkenham @ArkEncounter Yeah because the science is just... well... camel dung.@realDonaldTrump How do you have time to work w/ all that #golf? Didn't you say @BarackObama golfed too much? How many rounds have you played since inaug?@realDonaldTrump Yes, they are! Thanks, @BarackObama!@realDonaldTrump So when will you be raising a statue to #Hitler? Or #Mussolini? Or #GeorgeIII? I mean, let's celebrate history, right? #InvokeThe25th@realDonaldTrump You're right. You feel the racists and nationalists are superior to freedom-fighters.@aigkenham You're right. You white Christian jihadi terrorists have fucked this place up. Congrats.@revndm @yashar Yeah. Kind of hard to run with a Faux News ego shoved up one's ass.@yashar @revndm Run, Holly. Run.@DavidMDrucker @EricCantor @dcexaminer Eric who?@NickYoussef What about a lazy antifa? Can I wear a blindfold?@realDonaldTrump Tickets? Will a white hood be sufficient?@WhiteHouse So they get their hoods at the end of the program?@el_freemano Well that helps absolutely nothing. We know the sources of hate and violence. We need solutions to protect rights and lives NOW.@el_freemano And in the interim? The oppressed are just supposed to sit there and be lynched or sent to concentration camps or have their children raped?@el_freemano "You're inferior and have no rights to life or civil protections." What's a mutually acceptable solution to that philosophy?@GerryDodge1 @aigkenham Where did I say objective morality doesn't exist? Any other words you want to put in my mouth?@realDonaldTrump Stop playing golf, @BarackObama! Oh. Oops. #hypocrite@aigkenham Yeah, slavery and genocide. That's a real role model for today's children. Good call.@aigkenham #showmetheproof #wheresthebeef #claimswithoutREALevidencearefairytales@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because @realDonaldTrump can't keep his mouth shut and, oh yeah, is supporting the #white #Christian #jihadi #errorists.@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump The #American people are to thank for these highs. They're hardwork and sacrifices are KEEPING America great. #Trump is just a lameduck.@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Your grasp on economics (&amp; more importantly reality) is sorely lacking. Care to look at the trend numbers in the 5-8 years preceding #Trump?@realDonaldTrump So much for #winningbigly. I guess you're just upset the Forum couldn't declare #bankruptcy. #invokethe25th@WaysandMeansGOP @WhiteHouse You mean the tax codes YOU broke at the behest of Big Money? #Congressboughtandpaidfor@reppittenger Then why do you support @realDonaldTrump ?@kylebradleyG @tedcruz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump "drinking KKKool-Aid" isn't a personal attack. A sugary, fruity beverage isn't a person. I'm sorry that's not clear to you.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham That's fine. Ignore the words of your own holy text. Continue to justify slavery. Continue to ignore mass murder.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham I can't help someone who wants to believe in a god that condones slavery and genocide. That's your "cross to bear." Good luck.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham Given that you refuse to acknowledge any of the media I've shared with you and continue to just pose more questions, I'm finished.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham The bible condones the beating and killing of slaves. The ownership of a human being is disgusting at its very core.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham There's no distinction to be had. Did you view the article to which I linked or watch the video? Slavery in the bible wasn't some beachparty@kylebradleyG @tedcruz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If you can't understand the difference between a personal attack and a satirical literary device, I can't help you.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham All people should reject a book wherein a god commands slavery &amp; genocide, yes. The assumption is blacks are more attune to the woes of slav@DrAthanasius @aigkenham history of your people. 2@DrAthanasius @aigkenham African Americans suffered greatly under slavery in the US (and still suffer today). For you to minimize what slavery is is to ignore the 1@DrAthanasius @aigkenham I don't care about mythological fairy tale bloodlines. The god of your bible commands genocide and slavery, ergo your god is immoral.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham Genocide is the mass murder of people based on race or ethnicity; it doesn't necessarily result in the total extermination of a people.@kylebradleyG @tedcruz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hardly. I just don't have the bandwidth to deal with grown adults who think that namecalling is a responsible, mature way to conduct oneself@DrAthanasius @aigkenham I never made that claim. Your reading comprehension is terrible.@kylebradleyG @tedcruz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yay! Ad hominem attacks. You lose. Ciao.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham https://t.co/SHY1pFNqyn And if you have to ask me what's wrong with the owning of another human, you, as a black man, are completely lost.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham Matt is far better at this than I. Twitter doesn't allow the proper medium to destroy your apologetic. https://t.co/L4hdMDz6Zi@DrAthanasius @aigkenham Slavery apologist. Genocide apologist. I hope your daughter is taught better than you &amp; abandons your immoral mythology.@DrAthanasius @aigkenham If you want believe in &amp; worship a mythology that condones (&amp; commands) slavery, that's your right, but don't try to excuse its moral vacuum@kylebradleyG @tedcruz @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Stating moral equivalency between fascists and anti-fascists is NOT disavowal. Keep drinking the gold-colored KKKool-Aid.
