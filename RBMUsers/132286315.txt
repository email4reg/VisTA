@dmataconis I was in that crowd and saw (and filmed)  a man wearing a Trump flag &amp; another wearing an Israeli flag surrounded &amp; threatened by a mob@TheRightScoop However in fairness there was also a fair amount non-activist folks on #bostoncommon who approached &amp; thanked police for keeping them safe@TheRightScoop At the time I was there I didn't see that happen it but given a particular segment on #bostoncommon it would not surprise me in the least@dmataconis Because a lot of what I saw in Boston isn't going to play well  in the states that will decide the next election@dmataconis actually given what I saw on #bostoncommon I think dems have the choice lose the fanatical anti-trump anti US left or lose in 2020trying to upload the videos in the order that things took placewould have really liked to have gotten closer to the actual people from the base event to 1. See if they were really Nazis
2. cover speechesA lot of my stuff I'm saving for my post on the subject, bottom line #bostoncommon mix of sincere people, assorted activists &amp; masked thugs&amp; I felt ashamed I didn't have a Trump Banner or an Israeli Flag to wear myself  because what happened to them was disgraceful #BostonCommonuploading my videos fyi when crowd went after the guy in the @POTUS banner &amp; the other with the Israeli Flag my bias was loud #BostonCommon2. they didn't get that the far left activists from antifa to ANSWER to blacklivesmatter were basically using them as props #BostonCommonThose folks in my opinion were the best of the #BostonCommon crowd, but had two weaknesses.  1. They seemed to buy into the @potus racist BSsaid people while very anti trump were seriously worried about Nazi's &amp; the Klan &amp; thought it important to be on the #BostonCommon &amp; be seenThere were also a lot of people on #BostonCommon not associated with either antifa or the various activist groups I interviewed severalThat is very true in fact whatever you think of his @potus coverage Jake was one of the few to call out those who committed such violence https://t.co/YlNyMbsE0tFrankly if I was @realDonaldTrump I'd make it a point to schedule a rally on #bostoncommon &amp; give notice that he can draw a crowd in #Bostonlarge police presence kept antifa in check but da need to remind one's allies to please refrain from violence speaks volumes @Alyssa_Milanoso ANTIFA mostly basked in the approval provided of a crowd  either unaware of what they are or not caring what they are #bostonrallyantifa leaders understood the large police presence would check em &amp; huge media contingents meant trouble would be spotted fast #bostonrallyThere were several distinct groups at #bostonrally
1.  The Antifa thugs mostly masked &amp; ready for trouble, but their leaders were smartThe brightest side of #BostonCommon today was the various Police hands down https://t.co/zOlHOZc8EE #tcot #p2 #hfwtAfter seeing a man wearing an Israeli flag surrounded by a mob 
&amp; called a Fascist &amp; Nazi on the #BostonCommon I wonder if Boston is lost https://t.co/z2NWsHCDNGCan't imagine any Massachusetts supporter of @realDonaldTrump walking through #BostonCommon today without thinking "I need to arm myself"It seemed to me a lot of people had signs that said "no hate" but said signs should have said "no hate except for hating trump &amp; his voters"In my opinion the counter protests were not about opposing Nazi's as much as they were about opposing @POTUSBack home from #bostonrally #bostonprotest in one piece thanks to those who were worried some quick general thoughts....Two Boston Shoutouts.
