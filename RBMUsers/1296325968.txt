How long before God sends judgment? #DefundPPLife is precious! https://t.co/1xnNcteNPfIt's because there are so many in Congress w/o regard to life or Biblical values which makes it difficult to accomplish conservative values. https://t.co/2jOXYYVK4EJust one more SCOTUS Justice and the secular left will find its agenda stymied. Even their sacred cow abortion will be thwarted. #DefundPPNow, I also heard some PP offices turn around and sell the dead body  either as a whole or parts.
