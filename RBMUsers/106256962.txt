Thy grace sufficient shall be my supply."You hold me by my right hand. You guide me with your counsel." Psalm 73:23, 24.The Lord is with me, His rod and His staff, they comfort me.Lord, grant me that I may always look to you, in my troubles, in my distress, in my downcast pit, and see the gloriousness of Christ.I pray that as I walk in this daily journey, I shall be reminded that I am here only because I am here to be equipped in serving Him.I think one advantage to be not as smart as others is that it reminds me that I cannot do anything alone, only in and through God can I.It is the grace and strength of the Lord by which I strived through an intense hebrew 1.

Thank the Lord for Christ who became for us wisdom, and righteousness and santification, glory to God alone.I give thanks to the Lord for those whom He has placed in my life, pointing me to Christ and those who remind me of His faithfulness.I give thanks to the Lord because He not only walks with me since day one but He has been carrying me the whole time.Psalm 121 has been a huge encouragement to me throughout the month, it is humbling when we consider it's context, truly amazing.It is tempting to say, I want to walk with God all my life until it is revealed that it is He who walks with me, carrying me. Humbling.Theres no one trial too many or one too few, God will do everything necessary to make living stones that are fit for His service.Share MOSCOT with your friends and receive $10 OFF your purchase!
