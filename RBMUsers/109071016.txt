New @broadcity season out on my birthday. WHAT A PRESENT. Thanks @ilazer @abbijacobson ðŸ˜˜ #broadcity #yaaasssmy cat watching @NBCBlacklist. I think she loves James Spader's voice. #TheBlacklist #Reddington #cats https://t.co/dsaIobYIczSAY IT AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK https://t.co/drXuUJYuNcSo devastated to hear about #NelsanEllis :( an incredible talent that shattered stereotype of queer characters. #RIP #TrueBloodNeither being called what they are- TERRORISM &amp; HATE CRIME. #FinsburyPark #NabraHassanen. Makes me sick. 2/2So Muslims were attacked and killed outside their mosque &amp; a young #Muslim girl was murdered by a grown man on her way to #Ramadan feast 1/2@sajidjavid again, WHY did you vote against making homes fit for human habitation? Is it because you're a landlord? Shameful. #GrenfellTower
