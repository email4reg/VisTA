#gameofthronesStarks don't learn. Bran and Arya openly parading what they are capable of with Petyr Baelish around em is a huge blunder.

#GameOfThrones@mina_alexiaa Yea I heard the prequel is in the makings.@mina_alexiaa I couldn't read those books. The show spoiled me. The books are in too much detail while the show is more like the highlights which is fine.@mina_alexiaa Yup. There's nothing hotter than an evil Khaleesi.@mina_alexiaa Dragonheart. Lol@mina_alexiaa A reference to the movie. They got this character who has half heart of a dragon who turns evil.@mina_alexiaa She is a dragon heart. She is gonna turn red. As a fan of that character i cant wait for it.@mina_alexiaa Secondly that convo between jon and missandei where she is like dany will let me go if i ask her to. She might do that some day.
